# TeensyAmp R4.1

If not noted otherwise, all measurements at 48kHz sampling rate.

## Pre-amplifier

- R1=100k for grounding the signal
- C1=10uF and R2=4.7k for a 5Hz high-pass filter
- R2=4.7k and R3=47k for a 10x gain (gain=R3/R2)
- no low-pass filter 


### Reference voltage

- the voltage reference needs to be really stable!
