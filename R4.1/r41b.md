We do not need to access the GPIO pins of the PCM1865.


### Pre-amplifier

![preampinv](images/r41b-preampinv.png)

Let's have by default a 1x preamp gain.

R2 = R3 = 47kOhm.


## Status LED

| Teensy 4.1 pin | Teensy_Amp R4.1b | Teensy_Amp R4.2b |
| -------------: | :--------------- | :--------------- |
| 6 (was 26)     | LED1extern       | -                |
| 7 (was 27)     | -                | LED2extern       |

- 2 pins (GND, signal) in 2.54mm spacing


## CAN bus

Several R4.1 devices can be synchronized via CAN-FD bus.  The CAN bus
needs to be isolated from the rest and will be powered externally.

![can-isolated](images/can-isolated.png)

Isolation on the level of the CAN RX, CAN TX and the I/O lines. The
CAN transceiver is already behind the isolation barrier and is
powered externally.  Therefore, we do not need the shutdown and
standby functionalities of the transceiver anymore.

- CAN-FD transceiver: [TI TCAN332 D](../R4.0/tcan334.pdf) without any standby, silent or shutdown modes.

![TCAN332](https://www.ti.com/ods/images/SLLSEQ7E/D_sop_pin_diagram_tcan332.svg)

- 4 channel digital isolator (2 forward, two reverse): [TI ISO6742 DW](https://www.ti.com/product/ISO6742).
  See Figure 10-2 in the data sheet for layout design.

![ISO6742](https://www.ti.com/ods/images/SLLSFJ6G/GUID-20210126-CA0I-SGMD-HJJB-7CFZ95JL2VND-low.gif)

- Two additional digital I/O lines for indexing the devices.

- 2x (5)6-pin Connectors for external VCC and GND, CANL, CANH, and one I/O line.

## Grid configuration

See [power tests](powertest/powertest.md)

One power source driving several PCBs.


## Real-time clock

Add the [MAX31328](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX31328.pdf) temperature compensated real-time clock to the PCB. It is a modernized and apparently software compatible [DS3231](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ds3231.pdf).

A CR1220 3V Battery should be enough.

Note that the default implementation works only for the first I2C bus.

| -               |  8 VBAT    |


## Device identifier DIPs

For setting a device identifier that can be used to name the recorded
files, a 4-bit [rotary DIP
switch](https://www.mouser.de/datasheet/2/1628/rds_74385_smt-3510719.pdf)
is connected to Teensy pins.

| Teensy 4.1 pin    | Teensy_Amp R4.1b  |
| ----------------: | :---------------- |
| GND               | GND               |
| 34, 35, 36, 37    | DIP bits 0 - 3    |


## Power

Add just two power soldering pads for 3.7V LiPos.
And 3.5mm pitch Klemmblock.

With on/off switch closer to the analog side.


## Push-button

One push-button for starting and stopping data acquisition in a
controlled way.

| -------------: | :--------------- |
| 32             | Push button      |


## External sensors and devices

Potential external sensors and devices to be connected to the R4.1b:

- One-wire bus (GND, 3.3V, data with 4.7kOhm pull-up resistor): e.g. Dallas DS18x20 temperature sensor.
- I2C bus: temperature and illumination sensors.
- SPI bus: Display?

- SPI: vertical connector with 6 pins in 2.54mm spacing (GND, 3.3V, CS, SCK, MOSI, MISO)
- OneWire: vertical connector with 3 pins in 2.54mm spacing (GND, 3.3V, DATA + 4.7kOhm to 3.3V)


## Connectors

Let's go for the molex [Micro-Lock Plus](https://www.molex.com/content/dam/molex/molex-dot-com/products/automated/en-us/applicationspecificationspdf/505/505565/5055650000-AS-000.pdf).

For 1.25 pitch, the 8 pin receptable housing is 12mm wide, the 4 pin one 7mm.

Also check the 2mm pitch! The 8 pin receptable housing is 18.8mm wide. The 4 pin one is 10.8mm wide.
