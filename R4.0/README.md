# TeensyAmp R4.0

Work in progress.

With digitaly adjustable gain and filter settings.

## TODO

- check annotation of the PCB - CH1 and CH2 on the top side might be wrong.
- Make connection REF_LDO permanent
- Move pads for channel routing closer together, such that they can be
  soldered without the 0Ohm resistance.
